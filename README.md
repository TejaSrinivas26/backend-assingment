ProductService
The ProductService class is a service component that provides CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for managing products in the application. It acts as an intermediary between the controller layer and the data access layer, utilizing the ProductRepository for data persistence.

Dependencies
The ProductService class depends on the following components:

ProductRepository: This component handles the data access operations for products.
Usage
To use the ProductService, you can inject it into your controller or any other component where product-related operations are required.

Methods
The ProductService provides the following methods:

getAllProducts(): Retrieves a list of all products in the system.
getProductById(Long productId): Retrieves a product by its ID.
getAvailableProducts(LocalDate startDate, LocalDate endDate): Retrieves a list of products available between the specified start and end dates.
createProduct(Product product): Creates a new product.
updateProduct(Long productId, Product product): Updates an existing product with the provided ID.
deleteProduct(Long productId): Deletes a product with the specified ID.
These methods allow you to perform various operations on products, such as retrieving, creating, updating, and deleting them.

Configuration
To use the ProductService, you need to ensure the following:

The ProductService class is annotated with @Service to enable it as a Spring service component.
The ProductRepository dependency is properly configured and injected into the ProductService constructor.
Make sure to configure the appropriate database connection and ensure that the necessary tables and data exist for the ProductService to function correctly.

Dependencies
The ProductService class has a dependency on the ProductRepository interface, which provides the necessary methods for interacting with the underlying database or data source. Ensure that the ProductRepository implementation is properly configured and injected into the ProductService using the appropriate dependency injection mechanism.

Thread Safety
The ProductService class is designed to be thread-safe. Multiple threads can safely use an instance of the ProductService simultaneously without encountering any concurrency issues. However, make sure that any shared dependencies, such as the ProductRepository, are also thread-safe or properly managed for concurrent access.

Extensibility and Customization
The ProductService class can be extended or customized to fit your specific business requirements. You can add additional methods to perform more complex operations on products or introduce new functionalities as needed. Additionally, you can integrate other components or services within the ProductService to enhance its capabilities and integrate it seamlessly into your application architecture.

Consider an application that allows customers to rent products for a duration.
Duration could be couple of hours, days, or week, etc.
Application Flow:
1. Customer comes to application. Selects a sports category like ( Cycles, Rackets)
and then choose a duration for which he want to rent the product and submits
(similar to zoom car user experience)
2. Application returns a list of product details along with price for the duration selected.
Tasks: Build 2 API Endpoints
1. Return a list of all the available products with product name, image, cost for the
duration etc.
Note: if a product is already booked and booking dates overlaps with search
duration, don't show that product in the list.
2. Create a rental booking: Create a user rental booking for a specific product and
duration.
Feel free to take assumptions, hard-code if required.
